##### Overview: What is PUBMED?

PubMed is a free search engine that primarily accesses the MEDLINE database of references and abstracts on life sciences and biomedical topics. It provides a critical repository of peer-reviewed literature, essential for medical researchers.

##### Usage: How to use PUBMED on Insight

4- Once a PubMed task has been executed, you can deepen the scientific understanding by opting for another task. This could be an additional PubMed task or other relevant tasks.

5- Pubmed references will be listed under citations.

##### Applications:

PubMed serves as a foundational tool for any medical research project. With its vast repository:
