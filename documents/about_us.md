# About Us

Redefining Medical Research with AI
At Insight, we're more than just a platform. We're a team of passionate individuals on a mission to reshape the way medical research is conducted. Founded in August 2023, we've committed ourselves to creating an intuitive, reliable, and innovative tool that stands as a trusted ally for researchers worldwide.

## Our Vision
We believe in a world where every researcher, regardless of their background, has access to state-of-the-art tools and resources. By bridging the gap between vast data and meaningful research, we strive to make the process of discovery more efficient, precise, and profound.

## Our Journey
In the first two weeks after our inception, we've achieved over 1,000 research objectives in our beta phase and have been recognized by esteemed communities such as the Llama Index. But this is just the beginning. With continuous feedback from our user community and our commitment to integrating the latest in AI and medical research, we are ever-evolving, ever-improving.
