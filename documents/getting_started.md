# Getting Started with Insight

Welcome to the Insight getting started guide! If you're new to the platform or simply looking for a refresher, you're in the right place. By the end of this guide, you will be able to define a research objective and have Insight conduct a literature review, formulate hypotheses, and aid in the design of an experiment.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start: Running Your First Objective

##### 1- Accessing Insight:
- Visit the [Insight platform](https://insightai.dev/). No need to log in if you're just browsing!
- If you'd like to save your previous objectives or maintain a personalized dashboard, [register](https://insightai.dev/signup) for an account and [login in](https://insightai.dev/login).

##### 2- Initiate your Objective Research:
- Navigate to the dashboard and select 'New Objective'.
- Input your medical research question or statement into the provided field.
For better results, write your research objective using specific language. For example, "Assess the Efficacy of CDK4/6 Inhibitors in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer."
- Click the 'Research' button.

##### 3- Build Insight's Scientific Knowledge:
- The first output you will see after initiating your objective research is Insight's Thoughts, which includes the plan to address the objective.
- Insight will generate tasks that can be executed using our integrated features, such as PubMed, MyGene, MyVariant, or NIH RePORTER.
- Select a task of your liking for the first cycle, and Insight will execute that task to build a scientific summary and hypotheses.
- If you would like to generate an experimental design for a specific hypothesis, click "generate experimental design," and you will receive proposed experiments for the selected hypothesis.
- Check the citations section at the end of the cycle to review all the references to the literature reviewed by Insight.
- Below the first cycle, you will see the updated plan under "Insight's Thoughts," refined based on the acquired knowledge with a new list of tasks. With every additional cycle, Insight's knowledge grows, and the outputs become more specific.

Thank you for embarking on this journey with Insight. Our platform is continually evolving, and your input is invaluable to us. As you navigate through and use Insight, we invite you to share any feedback or queries you may have.
